<p>Gimmicks in art can be such an amazing thing! Lately I’ve been working on a project to write a song for all 700+ pokemon in an attempt to harness some gimmicky creative coolness. A lot of my musician peers find this project interesting but I wanted to take a moment to clarify what I think I’m trying to do with it. I wanna try to speak in general terms though so I’m going to be discussing gimmicks in art and why I find them very helpful and fascinating. I want to try talking in the abstract because while I’m thinking of my particular musical gimmicky project right now - I think everyone can add a little bit of gimmick to their artistic ventures~<b><br></b></p><p>To begin with, gimmicks can form a source of inspiration. If you utilize a gimmick correctly it can provide you a jumping off point to help with writer's block. A gimmick is taking just a small idea or a fragment of a concept and trying to expand on it until (sometimes) it gains new meaning. For example - let’s say you think it would be funny to wear an eyepatch when you perform shows. You can draw on this the next time you have writer's block and write a song from the perspective of a pirate or something! I know it sounds silly and goofy, but running with your sillier or goofier ideas can be very liberating! </p><p>Additionally, in a sense gimmicks are self imposed boundaries/expectations. Maybe you’re thinking, “I wanna make art, I don’t want boundaries!!” Well, I find boundaries in art very comforting and, more importantly, useful! It’s almost like you’re giving yourself an assignment from a class (and as a total nerd this appeals to me). Also, if you create boundaries you can also create themes, motifs, and patterns. These are not only cool artistic tools but you can also consciously (or unconsciously) break these rules to create more cool artistic creations! Continuing with the eyepatch concept: Let’s say you go to an open mic with an eye patch and fully dressed as a pirate. You can then play a song/tell a joke about how you are NOT a pirate but just have pink eye and you thought this outfit would match your eyepatch! By subverting that expectation you made an truly fantastic and amazing joke ;)</p><p>Lastly, gimmicks have a connotation with not being serious and this is such an underrated resource in my opinion! If you don’t take your artwork too seriously, then maybe you’ll be more willing to take risks. Maybe those risks will even pay off as something really interesting! I don’t want to imply that art doesn’t have a place for super duper serious work but I think it is more fun to have fun and since I make art to have fun then I’m gonna have a little fun. And even if your project is primarily serious, adding a little element of goofiness through a gimmick could help provide a nice contrast. It’s a balance, which is interesting to explore!</p><p>So yeah - I’m not saying you have to make every piece of art you make a joke or only work with gimmicks but I encourage you to embrace your sillier ideas! What you may dismiss as dumb at first could lead to some really neat ideas. </p>
