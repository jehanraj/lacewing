<h4>Summer is here. Photos by Cody Burawski.</h4>

<p>Hello everyone,<b><br></b></p><p>Spring has sprung in Montreal, which means that it has been exactly 3 weeks since I’ve had to wear snow boots. &nbsp;On top of that, I just wrote my second-to-last exam of undergrad!!! I am really disoriented from the nightmare I had last night about missing the exam, but overall things are going really well.</p><p>Wow, writing this is hard. &nbsp;Not, like, emotionally, but just like, writing is hard, and there’s a lot that’s been going through my head lately. &nbsp;Graduating is scary! &nbsp;I’m very, very lucky that I got into graduate school for the fall and that I’m really excited to go, but it’s still a massive life change. &nbsp;I’ve also been doing a lot of thinking about, well, things I need to work on going forward. &nbsp;I have a habit of choosing one thing to focus all my energy and attention on, and ignoring everything else until I’ve completely run out of interest and/or fuel. &nbsp;This is great for some purposes, but I discovered during my undergrad that it leads to swift and unavoidable burnout. &nbsp;Also, a total inability to complete administrative tasks, which sometimes turn out to be important (I narrowly escaped forgetting to file my taxes this year). &nbsp;More than that, I’m slowly realizing that you need to be aware of your life, because it will keep happening to you even if you ask it nicely to hold on a few weeks, or months, or years while you just finish up this project.</p><p>I think I’m getting better, though! &nbsp;I have learned a lot over the past four years. &nbsp;Mostly, I’m really starting to internalize that sometimes, other people are wrong, and you can ignore them. &nbsp;And I have a long and wonderful summer to think about these things and figure out how I want to deal with them when they inevitably come up. &nbsp;Mostly, though, I’m going to make meals that have vegetables in them and maybe read a few celebrity memoirs. &nbsp;I love celebrity memoirs because it’s like gossip, but they wrote it themselves, so I don’t have to feel bad about it. &nbsp;I will also chop off (most of) my unmanageable mane of hair and buy some shoes that don’t have holes in them. &nbsp;Boy! &nbsp;Just thinking about it gets me overwhelmed. &nbsp;I’m not used to this much free time.</p><p>Well, I have a lot to think about. &nbsp;I hope you all have wonderful summers, full of as much forced relaxation as mine. &nbsp;And please let me know if you read any good celebrity memoirs.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dr. Cat</p>
